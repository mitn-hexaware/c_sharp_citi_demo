Generate Java code for application getting built for US based bank offering wide range of credit cards including Diamond card, Platinum card and Premier card
Generate code for following uses cases
1. Batch job which reads csv file containing information about multiple credit card applications. For each credit card application, it should use external API to get credit score and apply rule that credit score should be between 500 and 850 for approving credit card application. Reject Diamond card if annual income is less than $50000. Reject Platinum card if annual income is less than $100000. Reject Premier card if annual income is less than $120000. Diamond card will have default credit limit of $5000. Platinum card will have default credit limit of $15000. Premier card will have default credit limit of $25000. It should also calculate credit card limit for approved applications based on card applied. Save all credit card application details in database along with status on approval and credit limit. Call third party card issuance service for all approved card.
2. Batch job which generates monthly credit card statement based on transactions for each credit card. Credit card information and transactions needs to be read from database. Apply annual charges if card anniversary falls in that month. There is no Annual fee for Diamond card. It is $50 for Platinum card; but waived off if annual spend is $20000 or more. Annual fee for Premier card is $100; but waived off if annual spend is $40000 or more. Calculate interest based on APR of 20% for balance which is carried from last pay date. Also calculate late fees if last bill is not paid on time. Late fee will be $2 for amount less than $1000, $4 for amount between $1000 & $5000 and $8 for amount above $5000.
Code should use C#.NET. Separate code files for batch processing, business logic, DB operations (for SQL Server database), external API calls, stored procs, db schema
